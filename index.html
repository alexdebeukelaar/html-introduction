<h5>Funny story</h5>
One time I went to a restaurant with my girlfriend. She decided to pay and went inside. When she came back outside I asked her how did u tell the guy wich table we where at and she said at table with the guy with the blue shirt.
And I was so confused because I thougt I was wearing a grey shirt. But apparantly my shirt was teal. So it turns out I cant see teal it's a different color everytime.
